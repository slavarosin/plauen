# This property specifies the underlying DBMS implementation. Supported values are 'oracle', 'db2', 'mysql', 'hsqldb',

### DatabaseModule's DbMaintainer configuration ###

# If set to true, the DBMaintainer will be used to update the unit test database schema. This is done once for each
# test run, when creating the DataSource that provides access to the unit test database.
updateDataBaseSchema.enabled=true

# Indicates the database must be recreated from scratch when an already executed script is updated. If false, the
# DBMaintainer will give an error when an existing script is updated.
dbMaintainer.fromScratch.enabled=true

# Indicates whether a from scratch update should be performed when the previous update failed, but
# none of the scripts were modified since that last update. If false a new update will be tried only when
# changes were made to the script files.
dbMaintainer.keepRetryingAfterError.enabled=false

# Set this property to true if the dbmaintain_scripts table should be created automatically if not found.
# If false, an exception is thrown when the table is not found, indicating how to create it manually.
# This property is false by default to be sure that a database is cleared by accident. If an executed
# scripts table is available, we assume it to be a database managed by dbmaintain.
dbMaintainer.autoCreateExecutedScriptsTable=true

# Comma separated list of directories in which the database update scripts are located. Directories in this
# list are recursively searched for files.

# If set to true an XSD or DTD will be generated that represents the structure of the database schema. This XSD or DTD can be
# used in datafiles to verify if they are up-to-date and to enable code completion.
