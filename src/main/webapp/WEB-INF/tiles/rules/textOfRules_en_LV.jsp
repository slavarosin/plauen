<b>GoBro</b><sub>©</sub> is a group GAME where anybody can participate.
<br>
<br>The GAME is not a lottery, casino or auction. There are no accidental elements and hidden information in the GAME, and the development of the GAME is shown on the Net in the real time. Anyone can win the GAME; the victory depends on the will, on the number of devoted friends and right strategy.
<br>
<br>To begin the GAME, an applicant has to register at the site, and then choose the GAME to participate in. Registration for a GAME begins seven days before the GAME. Each player who has registered in the GAME will receive a unique code to be used by the player’s support group and by the player to earn the votes required to win the GAME. If a player participates in more than one GAME, a unique code will be granted for each of the GAMES.
<br>
<br>The GAME also continues for seven days – this is the period for the players to gather supporting votes. After each play day the weakest players will be sorted out. Therefore only 600 top players of the first play day will start the second play day, 500 players will start the third day, 400 – the fourth day and so on. Finally the 100 best players will start the fight for the main award of the GAME on the last day. And only one on them wins. The votes collected by a player during each play day will be summed up and the person who has the most votes in the end of the GAME is the winner. In case of draws the player wins for whom more friends have voted (unique phone numbers of voters). If these numbers are also equal, the person wins who earlier registered for the GAME.
<br>
<br><b>HOW TO PLAY?</b>
<br>
<br>To get votes the player and his friends shall send SMS with the text:
<br>
<br><b>TXT GIVE5</b> XXXXXX (unique player’s code)  – price of message 0.35LVL – gives the player <b>5</b> votes
<br><b>TXT GIVE12</b> XXXXXX (unique player’s code)  – price of message 0.75LVL – gives the player <b>12</b> votes
<br><b>TXT GIVE21</b> XXXXXX (unique player’s code)  – price of message 0.95LVL – gives the player <b>21</b> votes
<br>
<br>to the number: <b>1897</b>
<br>
<br>Example: A message TXT GIVE5 123456 sent to the number 1897 will bring five votes to the player with the code 1233456.
<br>
<br>Be careful with spelling in the messages. Misspelled messages will not count and the money will not be paid back. Also note the time of a GAME’s beginning and end. The messages sent before the beginning of a GAME and after the end will not count and the money – not paid back.
<br>
<br>All GAMES begin at 12:00 (EET; CET +1; GMT +2) and end at 12:00 after seven days. Registration of the GAME begins at 12:00 seven days before the beginning the GAME and ends at 11:59 on the day when the GAME begins. One GAME begins and ends every day. A player may participate in any GAME or even in all active GAMES, but there is no sense in trying to kill all birds with one stone.
<br>
<br><b>HOW TO WIN?</b>
<br>
<br>TEAM PLAY is the basic strategy of the GAME. It means that you should not try to send as many SMS as you can yourself but rather involve as many friends as you can. As Russian proverb says “better to have one hundred friends than one hundred roubles” – if each of your friends sends an SMS with your unique code, you will gather all the votes and it is a half of the victory! There is no limit to the amount of telephone numbers from which your friends or acquaintances can vote for you, but there is a limit to the amount of SMSs that you can send from your own telephone number (you will have to check it with your mobile operator).
<br>
<br>Remember that every day the less active players will be sorted out; therefore, if you decide to play, you better follow the scores during the week! The best player wins; the passions grow and even burst out on the last day. Remember that only 100 players will reach the finals and only one wins. It is the last day when the person who is the second may suddenly become the first by involving all his / her colleagues or classmates. If you rely on yourself only, victory will not come easily.
<br>
<br>Good luck and remember that someone wins every day! Maybe today is your day! Let’s play!
