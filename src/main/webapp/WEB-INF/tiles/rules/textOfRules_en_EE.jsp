<b>GoBro</b><sub>©</sub> is a group GAME where anybody can play.
<br>
<br>The GAME is not a lottery, a casino or an auction. There are no accidental elements and hidden information in the GAME, and the development of the GAME is shown on the Net in real time. Anyone can win the GAME; the victory depends on the desire to win, on the number of devoted friends, and on the right strategy.
<br>
<br>To participate in the GAME, the contender must register as the website user and select a GAME (s)he is interested in. The GAME lasts for 7 days, during which time the players gain votes in their favour. One can join the GAME on any day during its active stage period. Every registered GAME participant will receive a unique code to be used by the player and his/her support group to accumulate votes needed to win the GAME. If one player simultaneously participates in several GAMES, (s)he will receive a different unique code in each GAME. Vote accumulation can begin immediately after the GAME registration and receipt of the unique player code. The player who had registered in the GAME but failed to gain a single vote in the first 48 hours after the registration time or after the last vote instance will be automatically expelled from the GAME participants’ lists at any of its stages, unless the player is in first place at the moment of expulsion. If the player was expelled from the GAME due to inactivity and decides to register again for participation in the same GAME, all his/her points accumulated there previously will be cancelled.
<br>
<br>And only one on them wins. The votes collected by a player during each play day will be summed up and the person who has the most votes in the end of the GAME is the winner. In case of draws the player wins for whom more friends have voted (unique phone numbers of voters). If these numbers are also equal, the person wins who earlier registered for the GAME.
<br>
<br><b>HOW TO PLAY?</b>
<br>
<br>To get votes, the player and his friends must send SMS with the text FOR PLAYER XXXXXX (unique player’s code) to the following numbers:
<br>
<br><b>1311</b> – price of message 5 kroons – gives the player <b>5</b> votes
<br><b>13011</b> – price of message 10 kroons – gives the player <b>12</b> votes
<br><b>15330</b> – price of message 15 kroons – gives the player <b>21</b> votes
<br><b>13013</b> – price of message 25 kroons – gives the player <b>40</b> votes
<br><b>13015</b> – price of message 35 kroons – gives the player <b>63</b> votes
<br>
<br>Example: A message FOR PLAYER 123456 sent to the number 1311 will bring five votes to the player with the code 1233456.
<br>
<br>Be careful with spelling in the messages. Misspelled messages will not count and the money will not be paid back. Also note the time of a GAME’s beginning and end. The messages sent before the beginning of a GAME and after the end will not count and the money – not paid back.
<br>
<br>All GAMES start at 20:00 (EET; CET +1; GMT +2) and finish at 20:00 seven days later. Every day one GAME begins and one GAME ends. The player can participate in any and all active GAMES, but consider this: how many birds can you kill with one stone?
<br>
<br><b>HOW TO WIN?</b>
<br>
<br>TEAM PLAY is the basic strategy of the GAME. It means that you should not try to send as many SMS as you can yourself but rather involve as many friends as you can. As a Russian proverb goes, “better to have one hundred friends than one hundred roubles” – if each of your friends sends an SMS with your unique code, you will gather all the votes and it is a half of the victory! There is no limit to the amount of telephone numbers from which your friends or acquaintances can vote for you, but there is a limit to the amount of messages that you can send from your own telephone number (you will have to check it with your mobile operator).
<br>
<br>Bear in mind that the least active players are expelled every day, so be sure to monitor the progress of your GAME over the whole 7 days. Victory favours the strongest player and things will reach boiling point on the last day. Remember – only one can win. It is on the last day that the player who seems to be a mere runner-up can unexpectedly soar to first place by involving all his/her workmates or classmates in the GAME. If you rely only on your own strength, you will find it very difficult to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat!
<br>
<br>Good luck and remember that someone wins every day! Maybe today is your day! Let’s play!
