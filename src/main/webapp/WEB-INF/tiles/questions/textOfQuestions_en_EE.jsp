<br/><b>1.  What is GoBro?</b>
<br/><b>GoBro</b><sub>©</sub> is a group GAME anybody can play.
<br/>
<br/>The GAME is not a lottery, a casino or an auction. There are no accidental elements and hidden information in the GAME, and the development of the GAME is shown on the Net in real time. Anyone can win the GAME; the victory depends on the desire to win, on the number of devoted friends, and on the right strategy.
<br/>
<br/><b>2. How to play?</b>
<br/>To get votes, the player and his friends must send SMS with the text FOR PLAYER XXXXXX (unique player’s code) to the following numbers:
<br/>
<br/>1311 – an SMS costs 5 kroons – gives the player 5 votes
<br/>13011 – an SMS costs 10 kroons – gives the player 12 votes
<br/>15330 – an SMS costs 15 kroons – gives the player 21 votes
<br/>13013 – an SMS costs 25 kroons – gives the player 40 votes
<br/>13015 – an SMS costs 35 kroons – gives the player 63 votes
<br/>
<br/>Example: A message FOR PLAYER 123456 sent to the number 1311 will bring five votes to the player with the code 1233456.
<br/>
<br/>Be careful with the spelling in the messages. Misspelled messages will not count and the money will not be paid back. Also note the time of a GAME’s beginning and end. The messages sent before the beginning of a GAME and after the end will not count, nor will the money be paid back.
<br/>
<br/><b>3.  How to win?</b>
<br/>TEAM PLAY is the basic strategy of the GAME. It means that you should not try to send as many SMS as you can yourself but rather involve as many friends as you can. As a Russian proverb goes, “better to have one hundred friends than one hundred roubles” – if each of your friends sends an SMS with your unique code, you will gather all the votes and it is a half of the victory! There is no limit to the amount of telephone numbers from which your friends or acquaintances can vote for you, but there is a limit to the amount of messages that you can send from your own telephone number (you will have to check it with your mobile operator).
<br/>
<br/>Bear in mind that the least active players are expelled every day, so be sure to monitor the progress of your GAME over the whole 7 days. Victory favours the strongest player and things will reach boiling point on the last day. Remember – only one can win. It is on the last day that the player who seems to be a mere runner-up can unexpectedly soar to first place by involving all his/her workmates or classmates in the GAME. If you rely only on your own strength, you will find it very difficult to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat!
<br/>
<br/><b>4.  How much does the GAME cost?</b>
<br/>Registration for the GAME is absolutely free of charge. The cost of the victory depends on the number of votes required to win.
<br/>
