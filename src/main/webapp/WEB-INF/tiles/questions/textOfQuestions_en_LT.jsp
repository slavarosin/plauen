<br/><b>1.  What is GoBro?</b>
<br/><b>GoBro</b><sub>©</sub> is a group GAME where anybody can participate.
<br/>
<br/>The GAME is not a lottery, casino or auction. There are no accidental elements and hidden information in the GAME, and the development of the GAME is shown on the Net in the real time. Anyone can win the GAME; the victory depends on the will, on the number of devoted friends and right strategy.
<br/>
<br/><b>2.  How to play?</b>
<br/>To get votes the player and his friends shall send SMS with the text:
<br/>
<br/>TXT GIVE5 XXXXXX (unique player’s code)  – price of message  1 LTL – gives the player 5 votes
<br/>TXT GIVE12 XXXXXX (unique player’s code)  – price of message  2 LTL – gives the player 12 votes
<br/>TXT GIVE21 XXXXXX (unique player’s code)  – price of message  3 LTL – gives the player 21 votes
<br/>
<br/>to the number: 1337
<br/>
<br/>Example: A message TXT GIVE5 123456 sent to the number 1337 will bring five votes to the player with the code 1233456.
<br/>
<br/>Be careful with spelling in the messages. Misspelled messages will not count and the money will not be paid back. Also note the time of a GAME’s beginning and end. The messages sent before the beginning of a GAME and after the end will not count and the money – not paid back.
<br/>
<br/><b>3.  How to win?</b>
<br/>TEAM PLAY is the basic strategy of the GAME. It means that you should not try to send as many SMS as you can yourself but rather involve as many friends as you can. As Russian proverb says “better to have one hundred friends than one hundred roubles” – if each of your friends sends an SMS with your unique code, you will gather all the votes and it is a half of the victory! There is no limit to the amount of telephone numbers from which your friends or acquaintances can vote for you, but there is a limit to the amount of SMSs that you can send from your own telephone number (you will have to check it with your mobile operator).
<br/>
<br/>Remember that every day the less active players will be sorted out; therefore, if you decide to play, you better follow the scores during the week! The best player wins; the passions grow and even burst out on the last day. Remember that only 100 players will reach the finals and only one wins. It is the last day when the person who is the second may suddenly become the first by involving all his / her colleagues or classmates. If you rely on yourself only, victory will not come easily.
<br/>
<br/><b>4.  How much does the GAME cost?</b>
<br/>Registration for the GAME is absolutely free of charge. The cost of the victory depends on the number of votes required to win.
<br/>
<br/><b>5.  Who can play?</b>
